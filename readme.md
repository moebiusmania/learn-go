# learn-go
> My personal takes in learning the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/).

This is mostly a collection of code from various tutorials, both from the official site and not. 

Nothing too serious, the needs is to backup my learning files with comments but I didn't wanted to create a repo for each single excercise.
